# brain-tumor-cnn
A CNN-based classifier for detecting brain tumors from MRI scans
# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification (CNN)

This is the planning and folder setup for my brain tumor classification project using deep learning.

---

## ✅ Goals

- [ ] Collect and prepare MRI dataset
- [ ] Build CNN for binary classification (tumor / no tumor)
- [ ] Train and evaluate model
- [ ] Analyze results (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- [ ] Create a clean Python codebase
- [ ] (Optional) Deploy model with Streamlit or Flask
- [ ] Write a blog post about the project

## 📁 Planned Folder Structure
brain-tumor-cnn/
├── data/ # MRI images and/or download instructions
├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for EDA + modeling
├── src/ # model.py, train.py, utils.py
├── outputs/ # model weights, logs, predictions

## 📌 Notes

No code yet — just getting started with planning and structure.
